- Choose 15 MW turbine (150 m)
- Interpolate the wind_speed for height 150m
- Choose MCP data (probably buoy 6)
- Short term analysis:
    - Mean, std of monthly and annual wind_speed
    - Weibull model
    - Windspeed profile [ws and wd] (binned by hour of day), and by month
- MCP for the ERA5 data
- Repeat anaylsis with corrected data
- Long term analysis
- Wind turbine power curves
- Foxes wake model (Pascal)
- Annual production of 1 turine and wind farm
